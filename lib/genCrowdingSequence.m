function Trials = genCrowdingSequence(conf, mode)
%GENTRIALCONDITIONS generates stimulus data and experiment settings based on `conf` struct
%
% We cannot have seperate QUEST sequences that measures thresholds for
% different variables in a single run of experiment, since that could
% complicate experiment. For example, we could measure the distance between the
% fixation to the target, and the spacing between the flankers and the target.
% These two variables both could capture the spatial profile of crowding. But,
% since they are both continuous variables, we should be using a
% two-dimentional QUEST to get the contour curves rather than blindly adjusting
% around using one-dimentional QUEST that we have now. So, we should always
% only measure one varibale using QUEST.
%
% That being said, we can still have several QUEST sequences under different
% discrete conditions for the same variable. For example, we could change the
% shape of the target so the salience is controlled under different levels,
% fixate the distance between fixation and the target (eccentricity), then
% measure the threshold for flanker spacing; or fixate spacing and measure
% eccentricity.
%
% As for implementation, we could only have one variable that specifies the
% procedure (for example "QUEST"), and all others could be generated. However,
% "Constant" and one adaptive method could be used simultenously for generating
% several sequences at the same time. For example, if the Shepe is "Constant"
% and flanker distance is quest, then several sequences of QUEST is generated
% for measuring threshold flanker distance for each level conbination of
% constants. Variables that specify constant should also provide the levels.

% SYNOPSIS: data = genSequence(nBlocks, nTrials, nStims)
%
% INPUT
%
%
%
% OUTPUT data
%       data.Trials is the output. This is a big table, each column representing a different variable. Here we implement —ïynamic generation; to be able to interface with standard psychophysics methods such as QUEST. *negative* integers in the variable field (such as those idx* will use different procudure to generate the random number for the next trials based on the data from last few trials). Refer to channelSelection() to see the negative integers and the specific method that is to be used.
