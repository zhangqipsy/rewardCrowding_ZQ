function [data flow]= recordCrowdingResponse(flow, data, conf)
% recordResponse records responses
%
% After a response has been collected, decide whether
% this resource is a correct response. If:
%   response is correct:
%       then record all the data for the first
%       occurance of the current trialID.
%       then continue doing the next trial with
%       the next trialID
%   reponse is incorrect:
%       move this trial to the end of all trials
%       for later data collection, labeling with
%       previous trialID
%
%   If a trialID is already present in a trial,
%   it means that trial was a moved trial for
%   data recollection. In this case, do not change
%   trialID, and keep using the old trialID.
%
%   During data analysis, all rows of data.Trials
%   whose counterTillCorrect is larger than 1 could
%   be ignoreË§? since those are re-collected in a
%   later trial.
